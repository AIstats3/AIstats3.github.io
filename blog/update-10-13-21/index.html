      <h1>Update 10-13-21</h1>
      <p>
        Hey what's going on y'all it's been a little while. I've been very busy brainstorming what else I can do to put
        out some good content. Basketball season is almost here, but as a Boston native it's more important to me that
        the Red Sox made it to the ALCS. I mean really, can we talk about Kiké Hernandez? The dude is hitting like .450,
        I'm getting shades of David Ortiz.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anyways, I think there are some good ideas kicking around in my brain so I'll provide an overview of what I've
        been doing and what you can expect to see going forward.
      </p>
      <h3>Offensive Versatility Score</h3>
      <p>
        I started this website because I had been calculating advanced statistics and wanted a place to post the
        results. If you want to read more about the concept of OVS, you can do so here. The essential idea being that it
        represents how many areas on the court a player can shoot from. I had previously been slowly, slowly,
        calculating scores by hand for each year. However, as you can imagine, this got tiresome, and I created some
        tools to make the process go much quicker. Using those macro commands I was able to calculate every score, for
        every player, for every year, between the 2003-2004 and 2019-2020 seasons, and will soon have calculated all the
        way back to 1997 when tracking data became available. The only thing I have to do now is to post the results I
        found, but this is a little bit of a problem. You see, I have so much data that I don't really know what to do
        with it all, and wordpress doesn't offer many services to make formatting easier. Because of this I will only be
        sharing the top 10-20 players on the website, and then I'll include a link to the sheet containing all the
        scores in the description. What excites me more about having a completed database of scores is using them to do
        some analysis with them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another big project that I have with OVS is calculating it for the ongoing NBA season starting on October 19.
        I'm going to put together a sheet and link it to this site so I can update the scores after every game, or at
        least do it weekly or bi-weekly. You can also expect to see some analysis related to OVS as the season goes on
        and I see what trends start to emerge. I'm interested to see how multiple players do, and to examine how that
        relates to team success. The Celtics are an excellent example of this, and Jayson Tatum will be a player to
        watch as the season goes on. With the strength he's added over the offseason it will be interesting to see if he
        continues to take mid-range shots when he isn't forced into as many by bigger players in the paint. Since it
        would be a valuable addition to a team which lacks a myriad of different ways to score, OVS will be a good way
        to measure how Tatum contributes to the offense.

      </p>
      <p>
        Players like Trae Young and Luka Dončić will also be interesting to study. With changes made to the rules for
        drawing fouls, the way they play could change. Luka may be impervious to this due to his crazy shot-making
        ability, but the Hawks' point guard could be forced to step inside the arc more and more as 3 point looks become
        harder to come by. In 2019-2020 Young had a near average score of 0.268 in 2120 minutes played with 45.5% of his
        shots coming from 3 point range, while shooting 36.1% on these shots. Perhaps the rule changes will make him
        take more shots in the 16ft-3 point range (shots that made up just 0.5% of his shots in the previous year, which
        by the way he shot 41.3% on).

      </p>
      <p>
        What overjoys me more than any of the work I'm going to do however, is that the stat works, IT WORKS!!!!!!
        Players like Chris Paul, DeMar DeRozan, and Dirk all are regulars among the elite in OVS, and players like Shaun
        Livingston and T.J. McConnell have been consistent high-scorers among role players. The consistency here is what
        really sells me, the fact that the same players appear over and over again makes me think I'm on the right
        track: that some phenomenon is being captured. Especially since those elite players mentioned above are players
        one would expect to dominate OVS due to their offensive style. Chris Paul in particular, each time I saw him at
        the top of the rankings I jumped for joy. It just confirms what we all knew, which is the huge value he provides
        in such a small package (sorry Chris).

      </p>
      <p>
        So, to conclude, I'm very happy with where OVS is at the moment. I plan to continue calculating it, as well as
        do some studies on it so I can understand each part as best I can and hopefully create a fine-tuned version of
        it some day. Until then, I can be happy with the fact that long twos may have a place in the world of advanced
        analytics.

      </p>
      <h3>New Ideas</h3>
      <p>
        The new stuff that I'm going to start working on is what I really want to talk about with you guys. I had an
        idea to measure player impact by tracking what percent of action on the court they are a part of, as well as
        what % of point, rebounds, assists etc… they account for. But the idea that I am most excited about is creating
        a stat to measure how good a player's post game is. I'm giving myself a challenge with this one, and I really
        look forward to it. The current plan is to use data from NBA savant which tracks what type of shots a player
        takes (hooks, fades, pull-ups).

      </p>
      <p>
        My attention was first drawn to this, and first started REALLY thinking about it while watching Giannis in the
        2021 playoffs. He made a conscious effort to add more moves to his arsenal as the 'yoffs went on. And it had a
        notable impact: teams had to change the way they played him, even if only slightly. And it eventually gave the
        Bucks a big enough push to win the championship, which infatuated me with trying to measure what Giannis had
        done.

      </p>
      <p>
        Quick aside: If Giannis spent a summer in the gym with Hakeem Olajuwon he could tap into bag akin to Kareem
        Abdul-Jabbar's skyhook

      </p>
      <p>But what really sold me is wanting to know how Zion would do in that stat. Since so much of his game comes from
        inside I wanted to see how he's able to get consistent looks from that range. It's an underrated art, getting a
        shot off in close quarters. A lot of physicality is involved with it for sure, but the best players are able to
        take it to the next level with skilled play near the basket.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next thing I thought of was DEFENSIVE Versatility Score, which I could combine with OVS to make a complete
        stat. I think doing a DVS would help me understand OVS a lot better and would be able to improve both by adding
        other components. I think to start it off I would just do a base version such that its a mirror or OVS: 0 is
        average and then a lower score is better and higher is worse, kinda in the same vein as ORTG/DRTG.
