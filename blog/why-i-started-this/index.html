      <h1>Why I Started This</h1>
      <p>
        Many think that the way basketball is played has gotten stale and unexciting. Watching games now feels like you're
        just watching people shoot 3's and draw fouls. Gone are the days when a standard 12-15 ft. shot was considered
        efficient. Three pointers are exciting, and admittedly more valuable, but the game isn't just about the numbers.
        There should still be room in the game for players who can take, and make, shots that advanced analytics say aren't
        worth the hassle.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        As a math and stats major, I felt like this was a problem that I had the ability to address. There needed to be some
        way to show that a long 2 can still be a worthwhile shot. Players like Paul Pierce, Chris Paul and others of their
        ilk can use their unique skill set to take unpredictable shots and keep their defender guessing. When this happens
        it opens another dimension of the game. Suddenly, you can't give them space while defending on the ball, or play
        drop coverage out of the pick and roll because they can take whatever shot you give them.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        This may seem trivial, and it could well be. But the ability to affect how an entire team plays defense because of
        the shots that you take has value that I think is understated. It is a soft-skill that is developed by repetition
        and attention to detail. It's a skill enabled by perfectly choreographed footwork and a good understanding of
        rhythm. These skills are the product of strong fundamentals, but some players haven't stopped mastering them. A logo
        3 can make an area erupt with applause, but personally a Tim Duncan bank shot will always jazz me up more.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        It's more than likely that this is just me throwing a tantrum in an excel spreadsheet, but it is damn fun to do. I
        hope you enjoy the show.
